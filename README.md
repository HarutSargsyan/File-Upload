# File-Upload ðŸ–‡

This project is a Full Stack File Uplaod project, the frontent is React and for backend I used node.js express framework.For storing files I used server's filesystem, though it's not a good practice, because after each server update filesystem get updated and you lose it, anyway it's the only way to store files for freeðŸ˜… for now and this project had also purpose to strengthen my skills in pure node.js filesystem modules. I hosted both client and server sides on heroku.
